# scTriangulate

scTriangulate is a Python package to mix-and-match conflicting clustering results in single cell analysis, and generate reconciled 
clustering solutions.

## Overview

![schema](./image/schema.png)

It can potentially be used in an array of settings:

1. Running same unsupervised clustering (i.e. Leiden) algorithm using different resolutions.

2. Running unsupervised clustering using different algorithms.

3. Running reference mapping tools using different reference atlases.

4. Clustering labels from matched multi-modalities (RNA, ADT, ATAC, etc)

## Citation

scTriangulate will be presented in [2021 CZI Single-Cell Biology Annual Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/142W5qCsXpv9CyyvQhmu_Re-Wf6mN7zZrAzarMMI6Se4/edit). 

A preprint will come out soon.
